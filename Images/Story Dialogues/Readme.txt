There was no Hagrid spirte so instead the dialogue box just shows his face
Also, blit these dialogue boxes at (0,450) since they are 150 in height

Eg. screen.blit(*name,(0,450))

the numbering is chronological

eg. dialogueStory1 - blit first, game starts and harry spawns close to hogwarts

dialogueStory2 - blit when harry arrives at hogwarts
	
dialogueStory3 - blit, harry arrives at hagrid's hut

dialogueStory4 - blit after winning first battle 

dialogueStory5 - blit after harry goes back to hogwarts to see dumbledore, spells are unlocked
